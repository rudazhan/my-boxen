# My Boxen

This is my Boxen project for auto-configuring a development environment for my future MacBook Pros. 

## What Do I Need to Install

* anaconda
  * [Command-line installers](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_macosx)

## Getting Started

> There are a few potential conflicts to keep in mind.
> Boxen does its best not to get in the way of a dirty system,
> but you should check into the following before attempting to install your
> boxen on any machine (we do some checks before every Boxen run to try
> and detect most of these and tell you anyway):

> * Boxen __requires__ at least the Xcode Command Line Tools installed.
> * Boxen __recommends__ installing the full Xcode.
> * Boxen __will not__ work with an existing rvm install.
> * Boxen __may not__ play nice with a GitHub username that includes dash(-)
> * Boxen __may not__ play nice with an existing rbenv install.
> * Boxen __may not__ play nice with an existing chruby install.
> * Boxen __may not__ play nice with an existing homebrew install.
> * Boxen __may not__ play nice with an existing nvm install.
